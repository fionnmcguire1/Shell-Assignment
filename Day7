Did some final checks on the system,formatted the ifc output as i used echo previously before so the output of this command
was all scrunched up together. Instead i simply called the command. I tested it against the root user to ensure i got the
correct output.

I also added an option to used ifc -a to show all the interfaces. The origional statment checked if the length of the statment
was less than 4 (user types in: ifc ). This ran a standard ifconfig command. Then i checked if the user input was greater
than 7 but less 11, this then checked the user entered eth to make sure the structure of the command was correct. This would
run the command for whatever interface the user used. The code i added today was to check if at the 4th character entered that 
the next 2 characters were '-a'. i did so by adding to the if statement: && [ "${input:4:2}" = "-a" ]; then
inside this if was a nested if to check if the input was greater than 4 but less than 7 which ran the ifconfig -a command.

I decided then to add more to the help manual.
