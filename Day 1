logged into node1 (existing vm on my machine)
created HomerJSimpson user with password: doh
did this by entering the following commands
su
(entered password)
useradd HomerJSimpson
Password: doh
Re-type password: doh

Looked at creating the shell in C,python. These seemed incredibly difficult to implement so i decided to stick with
bash shell scripting. Found a range of tutorials online in C which gave me the outline of what a shell looks like
i.e create a look, read line, plug that input into a function with arguments/ execute the command in stdin, output results.

Although that seems realitively basic, this was useful in giving me an idea on what was required.
Brian(lecturer) talks about forking and pids with external commands. I decided to create a plan for the assignment 
before i delve into that.

1. Create shell script, make executable with shebang
2. Produce welcome message
3. wait
4. readline
5. echo line
6. create a prompt
7. build internal commands using alliasing
8. Make HomeJSimpson (already done)
9. Make the shell script homejsimpsons default shell
10. exit (No termination, when user types exit, they exit the loop and therefore the script)
11. Logout user after exit
12. Build external commands
Extra credit
13. Build more commands that would make sense for a user to have with restricted permission
14. Stop the user from using certain commands
15. Format the output so it looks more readable for the user.

When i was working on my node1 virtual machine i tried to change the homerjsimpson shell but i didn't type his name at the end
This meant that i changed the su shell to a non executable file.
Every time i tried to change it back i got a PAM: Authentication failure.
I spents two and a half hours trying to fix it before giving up and creating a new VM called Shell assignment.
