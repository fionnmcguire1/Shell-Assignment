I was confused as to how one completes the internal command section of the assignment, I spoke with one of my classmates 
and he explained to me that internal commands were commands executed by the script and external commands call the 
command. So concider the date function. The date function is an external command if the custom_shell.sh implements 
it like this
>>> date
But if i create a seperate script, inside the new script call the date function and the shell implements 
it this by something like
>>>echo $(sh fionns_date_function.sh);
Then this is an internal command. So i had to configure my existing shell. I also had to figure out a way to upload 
my work to github. To try fix the apt get i looked online and found a stack overflow soloution that told me to go 
to /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d and add the lines 
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
These are apparently googles name servers. Apparently the issue i was having could have come from a static IP on my 
VM. However this did not solve the issue. After this i tried to add the addresses to /etc/hosts 
"91.189.91.24 security.ubuntu.com" >> /etc/hosts 
echo "91.189.91.24 archive.ubuntu.com" >> /etc/hosts
This also did not work.

First i decided to tackle the internal commands dt and ud. If the user enters dt then the date function must be outputted.
If the user enters ud then userID, groupID, username, groupname, iNode of userâ€™s home directory must be outputted. 
The date function seemed simple enough so i looked into the ud function. I searched and tested commands and found that 
it was fairly simple to get the most of the information using the command "id". However it seemed to be a very 
difficult task to return these in a readable format. I decided to get the uid and gid from formatting the command 
id using the operators -u (for uid) and -g (for gid). Then i got the username from "whoami" and the groupname 
from "groups". I didn't know how to get the iNode id so i checked stackoverflow. Stackoverflow showed me a 
command "stat -c '%i' /DIR" that could give me the iNode id of any given directory. I tested the command replacing
/DIR with $HOME and this seemed to work after i tested it on multiple accounts.

I created a shell script in bin called custom_shell_date.sh to implement the date function. Inside the script 
i simply wrote:
#!/bin/bash
echo $(date);

I then tested the dt command and it worked perfectly. This is an area where i could add further
functionality if i needed such as formatting the date.

Next was the ud function. I initiated the file with the shebang and then created a series of variables 
uid,gid,username,groupnames,iNode and set the values of these commands the output of their corresponding commands
id -u,id -g, whoami, groups, stat -c '%i' $HOME. Then i used printf to format the output. This worked fine, 
i then emailed brian to make sure what i had done was correct and then i could get started on extending features 
of the custom shell.

Extending features
- Command history using arrow keys
- format date function
- formatted option on ud function
- more commands
- Use script to print company logo
